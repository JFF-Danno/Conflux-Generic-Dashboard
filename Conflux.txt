Conflux Generic Dashboard.

The purpose of this project is to provide an easy to deploy and develop web platform for building DApps and Off Chain utilities.

The platform is built with Java Servlets and a Mysql database.
The Conflux Java SDK is used to make RPC calls for collecting off chain data and account data for the dashboard user.
The front end also makes use of the Javascript SDK.

Currently 2 objects are provided with some basic functionality, these are intended as code examples as well as providing functionality.
I expect this group of core objects will grow with each new project.
The 1st 2 are Address Records which can be displayed on the dashboard. A Blockchain Id project is on my list of ideas to research.
The 2nd is a Transaction Record. 

(Projects that could use this platform) My research list.

The Eth gas station helped me form my original idea here.

Going Forward.

All parts of the project are in need of a revisit before I wouldn't ask someone else to try it but I would happily start a new project with what is here.
I will produce a much more complete document to go with a more complete dashboard.
The front end is a hybrid of React and Jquery temporarily, I intend to rewrite the jquery to make it a full React App.
I came in short on blockchain experience so I chose a project where I figure I can add value at the same time as schooling myself on the RPC side of things.
